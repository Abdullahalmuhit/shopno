 Graduate programs offer students opportunities for specialized advanced education in their chosen

 the mission of an IT- based university, Daffodil International University is preparing to develop
 its research programs. The primary focus of this research is to be directed to the solution of problems
 and the development of knowledge and technology important to the nation and to the quality of life of
 Bangladeshi citizens. The university's research programs are designed to make important contributions to
 instructional programs through the involvement of graduate and postgraduate students and the renewal of
 the faculty. Research will also provide the knowledge based for outreach programs.

Extension and outreach programs are fundamental to the IT-based mission because these programs somehow

 outreach programs and increasingly involves the broader university in outreach programs that respond
 to the changing needs of the society in which we live. The university is continuing to seek new and 
 innovative ways to reach out to the people it serves.

Research is the means through which new knowledge is created and new information is developed. As such, research at Daffodil International University is an essential link in its three-prong mission of instruction, research and outreach. Successes among the varied research activities within each of its students and faculties continue to bolster Daffodil among the nation's top universities. Additionally, major efforts to increase the protection and commercialization of intellectual properties are central to Daffodil's continual drive for improvements in its committed mission.

These efforts mesh to create a teaching environment that enhances the country's economic, cultural, social and intellectual development and, at the same time, undergrads the university's undergraduate, masters and outreach programs.

Our faculties present cutting-edge instruction in a personable setting, taking into account the many career challenges that women face in today's society.
